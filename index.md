ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to my portfolio!

I am a Ph.D. student and currently a Graduate Student Researcherc in the department of [Bioengineering][BioE-UPitt] at [University of Pittsburgh][UPitt] from Fall 2024. I am also a member of the [Neuroscience of Aging Research (ARGO)][ARGO] and the [Studying emotional control circuits (Stujenske Lab)][Stujenske Lab] groups under the supervision of [Dr. Helmet Karim][Karim-UPitt] and [Dr. Joseph Stujenske][Stujenske-UPitt].

I graduated with both M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in [Electrical and Electronic Engineering][EEE] at [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)][BUET] in 2023 and 2021 respectively. 

P.S. I love to travel around the world, listen to music, play piano, watch movies/TV shows, watch and play different sports (football, cricket, long tennis and table tennis specifically).
