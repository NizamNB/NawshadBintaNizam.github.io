🎉 Welcome to my portfolio!

I am a Ph.D. student and currently a Graduate Research/Teaching Associate in the department of [Computer Science Engineering][CSE-OSU] at [The Ohio State University][OSU] from Fall 2023. I am also a member of the [Audio, Speech and Perceptually-Inspired REsearch (ASPIRE)][ASPIRE] group under the supervision of [Dr. Donald Williamson][williamson-osu].

My primary research interests include **auditory attention detection**, **brain-computer Interface**, **applied machine learning/deep learning**, **audio informatics**, **healthcare**, and **signal processing**.

Currently I am working on **An Audio-Video based Listening Study to Determine Physical and Neural Cues that Correlate with Speech Attention.**.

I graduated with both M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in [Electrical and Electronic Engineering][EEE] at [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)][BUET] in 2023 and 2021 respectively. 

P.S. I love to travel around the world, listen to music, play piano, watch movies/TV shows, watch and play different sports (football, cricket, long tennis and table tennis specifically).
